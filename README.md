**Author** : Mucong (Collin) Li
**Time Completed**: January 2020 

## Technical
**Method**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression    
**Language**: Python (notebook)        
**Data**: 16 columns and 2920 rows

## About the Project
**Stakeholder**: solar companies     
**Goal**: 
- Solar panel companies are facing problems. The key marketing message, that you can get profit without investment, is starting to get old and boring, which results in high sale cost and low conversion rate. The average cost per sale for solar panel in California is $1,929 with an average of 7% conversion rate.      
- To solve this problem, I propose that solar companies need to better locate the target audience and deliver a stronger marketing message. To accomplish these goals, I have conducted a Solar Panel Power Generation Analysis.
